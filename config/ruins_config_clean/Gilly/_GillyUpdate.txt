To install:  
   Place all the folders in mods/resources/ruins/

Let the folders merge and overwrite existing files with newer ones.


Note there are duplicate files for a few structures, ones with "Modded" in title use blocks from other mods (Tinkers Construct and Chisel2)
One or the other duplicate file can be removed from the "/generic" folder, depending on if you are playing with those specific mods in addition to Ruins
Keep all files in the "/Gilly" folder, it is an archive that active templates seek when calling support files.
