
This is the updated set of custom ruins made for my modded singleplay.  Blocks used are from 1.7.10 and a few have ones from standard mods.

        Early September 2015 (original set released mid March 2015)
  All files have had at least minor updates and overhauls for details since the first release


   Put the folder "Gilly" into /mods/resources/ruins along with the biome folders
       Most of these are support-files used mainly by the city settlement

<<<<<List of templates with basic descriptions>>>>>

Templates in the /Gilly folder spawn only if called from another template in /generic (or /templateparser or a biome folder)
Keep a copy of ALL files in the Gilly folder, this is where they need to be when called by an active template

Only spawn structures go in templateparser, or others for testing

   Use in worlds at own risk: if removing files from active directories, restart minecraft to clear from memory


All files have "Gilly" to ensure a unique filename when merged with other content
